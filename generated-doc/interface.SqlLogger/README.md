[resetConnection](#-resetconnection-dsn-dsn-connectionid-number--promiseunknown),
[disconnect](#-disconnect-dsn-dsn-connectionid-number--promiseunknown),
[query](#-query-dsn-dsn-connectionid-number-isprepare-boolean-nobackslashescapes-boolean--promisesqlloggerquery--undefined),

[dispose](#-dispose---promiseunknown)


#### ðŸ“„ connect?: (dsn: [Dsn](../class.Dsn/README.md), connectionId: `number`) => Promise\<`unknown`>

> A new connection established.



#### ðŸ“„ resetConnection?: (dsn: [Dsn](../class.Dsn/README.md), connectionId: `number`) => Promise\<`unknown`>

> Connection state reset (before returning this connection to it's pool).



#### ðŸ“„ disconnect?: (dsn: [Dsn](../class.Dsn/README.md), connectionId: `number`) => Promise\<`unknown`>

> Disconnected.



#### ðŸ“„ query?: (dsn: [Dsn](../class.Dsn/README.md), connectionId: `number`, isPrepare: `boolean`, noBackslashEscapes: `boolean`) => Promise\<[SqlLoggerQuery](../interface.SqlLoggerQuery/README.md) | `undefined`>

> Started to send a new query to the server.
> `isPrepare` means that this is query preparation operation (the query is not executed, but stored on the server).
> This function can return object that implements `SqlLoggerQuery` for further logging the query process.
> Query SQL (if any) will be handed to the methods of `SqlLoggerQuery`.



#### ðŸ“„ deallocatePrepare?: (dsn: [Dsn](../class.Dsn/README.md), connectionId: `number`, stmtIds: `number`\[]) => Promise\<`unknown`>

> Deallocated prepared query or multiple queries indentified by their `stmtIds`.



#### ðŸ“„ dispose?: () => Promise\<`unknown`>

> This callback is called when current `MyConn` object is disposed of. This happens at the end of `MyPool.forConn()`, or at the end of a block with `using conn = ...`.
